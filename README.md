# coursera-getting-and-cleaning-data-project

This is the course project for the Coursera Getting and Clearning Data Course Project.

The project sets up a tidy dataset for data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The repository contains this readmd.md file, the run_analysis.R file, the Codebook.md file, and the tidy.txt file.


The run_analysis.R is an R script file that downloads and processes the data to the resultant tidy.txt file.

The R script file does the following steps

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. <br/>
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br/>
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set<br/>
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.<br/>
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.<br/>
